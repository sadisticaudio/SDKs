A\+AX Library core support for the A\+AX interface 

The A\+AX Library includes several built-\/in features that are designed to facilitate plug-\/in development and to make it easy to create plug-\/ins with correct and consistent behavior. Although these features are not a part of the A\+AX A\+PI, they are a core part of the S\+DK. \subsection*{Documents}
