G\+UI Extensions for the A\+AX S\+DK. 

\hypertarget{a00838_about}{}\subsection{About the S\+D\+K\textquotesingle{}s G\+U\+I Extensions}\label{a00838_about}
The code and projects in the S\+DK\textquotesingle{}s Extensions/\+G\+U\+I/ directory demonstrate how to extend the A\+AX S\+DK\textquotesingle{}s G\+UI programming interface using a variety of popular G\+UI frameworks, including\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Native Cocoa
\item Native Win32
\item V\+S\+T\+G\+UI
\item J\+U\+CE
\end{DoxyItemize}

These projects do not represent core functionality of the A\+AX S\+DK, but rather they serve as examples of how plug-\/in G\+U\+Is can be written to the A\+AX specification using a variety of different approaches.\hypertarget{a00838_notes}{}\subsection{Notes}\label{a00838_notes}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The V\+ST and J\+U\+CE G\+UI Extension library projects use a macro value to resolve file paths to the installed framework directory. This macro is defined in a Visual Studio property sheet on Windows and as a custom project variable on Mac. Because this macro will not be resolved on Mac until compilation, the Xcode G\+UI will not be able to find the included files. However, the projects should builds successfully once the macros are updated to point to the correct directory.
\item The J\+U\+CE G\+UI Extension code in this S\+DK was written using version 1.\+51 of the J\+U\+CE framework
\item Several V\+S\+T\+G\+U\+I-\/based headers with an \char`\"{}\+\_\+ext\char`\"{} filename are provided along with the S\+DK\textquotesingle{}s G\+UI Extensions code. These headers are slightly modified versions of the corresponding headers that are distributed with V\+S\+T\+G\+UI. The headers have been modified for use with our example plug-\/ins because we had several problems when using the V\+S\+T\+G\+UI S\+DK for 64 bit. For example, we encountered conflicting typedefs redefinitions like int32\+\_\+t etc., which are preprocessed out of the vstguibase\+\_\+ext.\+h file. These headers should not be required to build a 32-\/bit plug-\/in and they were only added in our transitional A\+AX S\+DK, version 1.\+5.
