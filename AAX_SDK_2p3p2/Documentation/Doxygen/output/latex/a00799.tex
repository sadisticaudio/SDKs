\subsection{ }
The interface for a A\+AX Plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s user interface. 

The \mbox{\hyperlink{a01821}{G\+UI interface}} includes methods for handling the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s G\+UI window and events.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Accessing the window}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
In A\+AX, the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s window is provided as a native window pointer through the \mbox{\hyperlink{a01889}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+View\+Container}} interface. The plug-\/in may also use this interface to forward events in its window back to the host for handling.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Default implementation}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
A default implementation of the G\+UI interface, \mbox{\hyperlink{a01477}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+C\+Effect\+G\+UI}}, is compiled in to the A\+AX library. This class includes a few helper methods and other extensions to the base interface. Of particular note are several additional pure virtual methods that are used by this class to extend the G\+UI A\+PI, and which must be overridden by any inheriting class.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Extensions}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The A\+AX S\+DK includes several examples of how the basic G\+UI interface may be extended to support native or third-\/party G\+UI frameworks. These examples are not a core part of the S\+DK, but are provided to developers as a convenience when incorporating their own chosen G\+UI framework. \subsection*{Classes}
