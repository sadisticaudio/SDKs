\subsection{ }
How the A\+AX C++ interfaces work. 

The objects and interfaces in A\+AX are based on the Avid Component Framework (A\+CF). The A\+CF is Avidâ€™s implementation of C\+OM, and is the framework that A\+AX, as well as A\+VX (Avid Video Externsions) plug-\/ins are built on.

A\+CF can be considered an implementation detail of the A\+AX S\+DK; the S\+DK is written to protect plug-\/in developers from the intricacies of A\+CF, and it is not necessary to understand A\+CF or C\+OM in order to use the S\+DK.\hypertarget{a00827_details}{}\subsection{More details}\label{a00827_details}
As in C\+OM, A\+CF draws a distinction between the concept of an object and the concept of an interface. An object is treated as a \char`\"{}black box\char`\"{} of code, whereas an interface is a class of pure virtual methods that allows one to access the functionality inside the object. An object in A\+CF is represented by the \mbox{\hyperlink{a01409}{I\+A\+C\+F\+Unknown}} interface, which is binary compatible with the C\+OM class I\+Unknown. (Likewise, \mbox{\hyperlink{a01409}{I\+A\+C\+F\+Unknown}} follows the same reference counting rules as I\+Unknown objects.) This interface allows a client to get pointers to other interfaces on a given object using the \mbox{\hyperlink{a01409_a8b7f0ae9c78d007ca76aa462ebe53135}{Query\+Interface()}} method.

Reference counting is an important aspect of both C\+OM and A\+CF. Simply put, reference counting is the practice of tracking all references to an object, so that a program can determine when the object can safely be deleted. The A\+AX S\+DK library handles this reference counting behind the scenes, so plug-\/ins that call into the S\+DK library to manage their component interfaces will not leak references.

Many additional resources can be found both online and print that cover C\+OM and reference counting in greater detail.\hypertarget{a00827_acf_in_aax}{}\subsection{A\+C\+F interfaces in A\+AX}\label{a00827_acf_in_aax}
The binary interface between an A\+AX plug-\/in and host is defined by a series of A\+CF interfaces. Each of these interfaces inherits from \mbox{\hyperlink{a01409}{I\+A\+C\+F\+Unknown}}. The implementation of each A\+CF interface typically uses {\ttfamily C\+A\+C\+F\+Unknown}, a utility class that provides basic reference counting and additional fundamental A\+CF details to satisfy \mbox{\hyperlink{a01409}{I\+A\+C\+F\+Unknown}}.

These A\+CF interfaces may be implemented by either the A\+AX plug-\/in or the host. The host retains a reference to each interface that is implemented by the plug-\/in in order to call methods on the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s implementation. Correspondingly, the plug-\/in retains references to various interfaces that are implemented by the host, and may call host methods via these interfaces.

\doxyfigcaption{A\+CF interfaces\+: A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters and A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Controller}
\end{DoxyImage}
 The figure above demonstrates this design\+: the plug-\/in implements \mbox{\hyperlink{a01669}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters}} directly, and retains a reference to an \mbox{\hyperlink{a01637}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Controller}} that is implemented by the host.

In order to implement \mbox{\hyperlink{a01669}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{a01825}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+Effect\+Parameters}} inherits from {\ttfamily C\+A\+C\+F\+Unknown} and implements \mbox{\hyperlink{a01409_a8b7f0ae9c78d007ca76aa462ebe53135}{Query\+Interface()}} to ensure that the \mbox{\hyperlink{a01409}{I\+A\+C\+F\+Unknown}} interface is implemented. The rest of the implementation of \mbox{\hyperlink{a01669}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters}} is contained in \mbox{\hyperlink{a01481}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+C\+Effect\+Parameters}} and the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s custom data model class.

The reference to \mbox{\hyperlink{a01637}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Controller}} is managed by a versioned implementation class. For more information about this design, see below.\hypertarget{a00827_using_acf}{}\subsection{Using A\+C\+F interfaces}\label{a00827_using_acf}
Depending on where an interface is implemented, there are two specific ways to acquire a reference to the underlying A\+AX object from an \mbox{\hyperlink{a01409}{I\+A\+C\+F\+Unknown}} pointer\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{a00827_using_acf_host_provided_interfaces}{Host-\/provided interfaces}} \item \mbox{\hyperlink{a00827_using_acf_plug_in_interfaces}{Plug-\/in interfaces}}\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{a00827_using_acf_host_provided_interfaces}{}\subsubsection{Host-\/provided interfaces}\label{a00827_using_acf_host_provided_interfaces}
Interfaces that are managed by the host must be carefully version-\/controlled in order to maintain compatibility with many different host versions. The A\+AX S\+DK includes \char`\"{}\+A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+V\char`\"{} classes to handle this versioning. A\+A\+X\+\_\+V classes are concrete classes that query the host for the correct version of the requested interface. These classes can also handle re-\/routing deprecated calls and other complicated versioning logic.

To create an A\+A\+X\+\_\+V object, pass an \mbox{\hyperlink{a01409}{I\+A\+C\+F\+Unknown}} pointer to the underlying host-\/managed interface in to the A\+A\+X\+\_\+V class\textquotesingle{} constructor. A\+CF reference counting is handled automatically by the object\textquotesingle{}s construction and destruction routines, so no additional calls are necessary to acquire and release the reference.

Interfaces to objects that are owned by the plug-\/in always have a known version and therefore do not require A\+A\+X\+\_\+V object management. Instead, these interfaces must be acquired and released directly using A\+CF.

\hypertarget{a00827_ACF}{}\subsection{Interface versioning in A\+AX}\label{a00827_ACF}
The A\+C\+F-\/based interface used by A\+AX is designed to allow additional features to be added to the architecture. This can be achieved via the addition of new kinds of interfaces (e.\+g. \mbox{\hyperlink{a01817}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+Effect\+Direct\+Data}}) or by extending the existing interfaces. In this section, we will describe an approach for interface extension.

First, here is a more complete picture of \char`\"{}version 1\char`\"{} of the \mbox{\hyperlink{a01669}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{a01637}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Controller}} interfaces, including a possible host implementation of \mbox{\hyperlink{a01637}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Controller}} \+:


\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{dot_aax_acf_versioning_full}
\doxyfigcaption{A\+CF interfaces\+: A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters and A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Controller (with possible host design)}
\end{DoxyImage}
 To extend these interfaces, new \char`\"{}version 2\char`\"{} interfaces are created that inherit from the original interface classes. Although any version 1 method could be called on the new version 2 class, references to each interface are retained by the client in order to clarify the specific version in which each method was introduced.


\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{dot_aax_acf_versioning_plug-in_v2}
\doxyfigcaption{Adding a new version to A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters and A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Controller}
\end{DoxyImage}
 In this example, if the plug-\/in is loaded by an older host, the reference to {\ttfamily A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Controller\+V2} will return as {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL}, and calls to the V2 methods in \mbox{\hyperlink{a01789}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+Controller}} will return an \char`\"{}unimplemented\char`\"{} error code. Similarly, if a plug-\/in that only implements \mbox{\hyperlink{a01669}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters}} is loaded into a host that supports {\ttfamily A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters\+V2}, that host will receive a {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL} reference to the newer interface version and will only be able to call methods on the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s implementation of the original interface.

As a final example, here is a possible design involving new versions of both \mbox{\hyperlink{a01669}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Effect\+Parameters}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{a01637}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+A\+C\+F\+Controller}}, with an example design for the host\textquotesingle{}s implementation as well as the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s\+:
