This directory contains a legacy version of the AAXLibrary project which was used
with Xcode 7 and Xcode 8 build systems. This copy of the project file is no longer
maintained by Avid but it may be useful as a reference if you are using an older
compiler. It is configured to be run from the MacBuild directory which is one
directory higher than its location here; to use it, either update the relative
paths in the project file to include an additional directory level or move the
project file up one level in the directory tree.
