/** @defgroup AAXHostShell_API AAXHostShell framework API
 
 @brief API for the AAXHostAppliation framework
 
 @details
 A pure C interface exposed to AAXHostAppliation framework clients. Applications that wish
 to host AAX plug-ins may link to the AAXHostAppliation framework and use this API to load, run, and
 display plug-ins.
 
 <b>Interface compliance</b>
 This is a pure C interface. Client applications may be written in any C99 compliant language.
 
 <b>Error handling</b>
 The operations in this API return a @c bool indicating success (@c true) or failure (@c false). As
 a rule, if an operation returns @c false then it will leave the system in the same state as before
 it was called.
 
 @todo Create a real set of error codes for the API. Error codes should indicate whether errors or
 failures were successfully recovered from.
 
 <b>Lifecycle</b>
 Clients must call @ref AAXHShell_Initialize() before calling any other methods in this API, and must
 call @ref AAXHShell_Teardown() after completing all other API method execution.
 
 <b>Other conventions</b>
 - All methods in this API return a @c bool to indicate success or failure, as described above.
 - In this API documentation, term "operation" refers to a one-time action, while the term "command"
 refers to a doable or undoable action which may be loaded into and executed via a command list. See
 the @ref AAXHostShell_Operations and @ref AAXHostShell_Commands documentation for further
 information.
